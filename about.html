          <p>
            We started as small fashion company in 1920 with three people. Little by little, Fashionashion started getting more attention from the city then the state and 
            Boom! The whole nation. It wasn't long before we reached the neighbouring countries like Canada and Mexico.
          </p>

            Fashionashion is one of leading companies in the fashion industry. We won more than 100 awards and medals in the US and outside the country. Our company works with the biggest
            brands in the US. Just to name a few: companies like Nike, Addidas, and Puma.
          </p>

            Our models participate in many events, especially the well known ones that are held in large cities such as New York, Chicaago , and Los Angeles. Every year we go to many
            events and shows than the year before. We are always looking for ways to share our work with world.
